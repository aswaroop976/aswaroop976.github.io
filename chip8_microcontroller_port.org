#+title: Chip8 Microcontroller Port
* CHIP-8 emulator in Rust ported to the STM32f411 microcontroller
- This project was inspired by this blog post: [[https://dhole.github.io/post/chip8_emu_2/]]
- Here I will explain how I wrote a CHIP-8 emulator and ported it to an embedded ARM microcontroller, if you are curious about all the code here is the repository linked(ignore the name of the repository): [[https://github.com/aswaroop976/ssd1306_test]]
- I will split this post into two parts first talking about the backend, which consists of the CHIP-8 emulator, and then the frontend, which is where I will explain how I ported this emulator to a micrcontroller and interfaced with a display and buttons
- Additionally this post assumes pre-requisite knowledge of Rust(nothing too complex), and a basic understanding of computer architecture and embedded systems(although I will try to make this as beginner friendly as possible, linking to helpful resources whereever I can)
** Backend(CHIP-8 emulator)
- This part of the project was largely inspired from this blog post(seriously this post probably explains things way better than I ever can): [[https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/]]
